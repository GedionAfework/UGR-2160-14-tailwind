              Olive Academy is a private academy owned by Mr. Abebayehu and Mrs. Konjot. But, back then, the owner was the beautiful Ms. Haimanot. She was an amazing teacher as well as a second mother to me. She was my mom's close friend and she used to buy me a chocolate everyday. I loved her so much that I drew her once. In my stay at Olive, Ms. Haimanot played a huge role.
